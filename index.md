**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**\
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter is smart contracts. I didn't really have an idea how they were used before this project and now I understand how to implement them and their benefits.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**\
An investigation I would like to pursue would be utilizing side chains to take care of the verficiationa and transactions on the blockchain. This would help ease overhead and take advantage of chains made specifically for these tasks. 

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**\
One change I would make is implementing a ZKML version of verification of a buyer or seller.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**\
Some techniques I am interested in using is ZKML, MetaMask, and React.js. These are frameworks or technologies that I think we will need to use or should use in order to optimize or improve the project.
